No indeed, not I;<br>Perhaps some day, who knows?<br>But not today; it froze, and blows and snows,<br>And you’re too curious: fie!<br>You want to hear it? well:<br>Only, my secret’s mine, and I won’t tell.<br><br>Or, after all, perhaps there’s none:<br>Suppose there is no secret after all,<br>But only just my fun.<br>Today’s a nipping day, a biting day;<br>In which one wants a shawl,<br>A veil, a cloak, and other wraps:<br>I cannot ope to everyone who taps,<br>And let the draughts come whistling thro’ my hall;<br>Come bounding and surrounding me,<br>Come buffeting, astounding me,<br>Nipping and clipping thro’ my wraps and all.<br>I wear my mask for warmth: who ever shows<br>His nose to Russian snows<br>To be pecked at by every wind that blows?<br>You would not peck? I thank you for good will,<br>Believe, but leave the truth untested still.<br><br>Spring’s an expansive time: yet I don’t trust<br>March with its peck of dust,<br>Nor April with its rainbow-crowned brief showers,<br>Nor even May, whose flowers<br>One frost may wither thro’ the sunless hours.<br><br>Perhaps some languid summer day,<br>When drowsy birds sing less and less,<br>And golden fruit is ripening to excess,<br>If there’s not too much sun nor too much cloud,<br>And the warm wind is neither still nor loud,<br>Perhaps my secret I may say,<br>Or you may guess."
